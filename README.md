# Car Price Predictor With Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to predict car prices based on provided features. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about various cars.

## Project Files

1. **car_price_predictor.ipynb**
   - This Jupyter notebook contains the main code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Cleaned Car.csv**
   - The cleaned dataset used for training the machine learning model.

3. **LinearRegressionModel.pkl**
   - The trained Linear Regression model saved as a Pickle file for future use.

4. **quikr_car.csv**
   - The original dataset containing car information.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- Install necessary libraries using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
### Running the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sujoychandradas/Car_Price_Predictor_With-ML.git
    cd Car_Price_Predictor_With-ML

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
      ```bash
   jupyter notebook car_price_predictor.ipynb
3. Execute each cell in the notebook to explore, preprocess, train the model, and make predictions.

### Customization and Experimentation
Feel free to experiment with the code, tweak hyperparameters, or explore other machine learning algorithms to improve the model's performance.
